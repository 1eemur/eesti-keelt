## What is Estonian?

Estonian, or eesti keel, is a Finno-Ugric language written in the Latin script which is the official language of Estonia and one of the European Union's official languages. Estonian is spoken natively by roughly 1.1 million people, with an estimated 160,000 living outside of Estonia.

## Additions:
This site was created out of an abundance of notes I gathered during my time studying Estonian over the last year, but it is by no means an exhaustive list. I have no affiliation with any of the resources or coupons included. If you have any additional resources, links, or ideas, please feel free to reach out via Discord. I have my handle listed below.

## Disclosure
I have not created any of the content or resources on this web page and do not claim any ownership over the materials listed. I've simply built this site to act as a central hub, providing information to Estonian learners. This page was inspired by Priit and Jekk55's Google Doc from the Estonian Language Learning Server.
